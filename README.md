# FhirSide

A FHIR R4 compliant sandbox API for healthcare data interoperability. FhirSide provides a simulated FHIR-compliant healthcare system with synthetic patient data for learning, testing, and development purposes.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Educational Resource**: Help developers learn FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards
- **Development Sandbox**: Provide a safe environment for testing FHIR integrations
- **Clean Architecture**: Demonstrate .NET best practices and clean architecture principles
- **FHIR Compliance**: Implement FHIR R4 standard using the Firely SDK

## ✨ Features

### Current Features
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints for core FHIR resources
- ✅ In-memory data storage with sample synthetic data
- ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- ✅ FHIR R4 compliant resource models
- ✅ Docker support for containerized deployment

### Supported FHIR Resources
| Resource | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Patient | ✅ Implemented | Demographic and administrative information about a patient |
| Encounter | ✅ Implemented | Healthcare events involving a patient |
| Observation | ✅ Implemented | Measurements and simple assertions (vital signs, lab results) |
| MedicationRequest | ✅ Implemented | Orders for medications |

### Planned Features
- [ ] SMART on FHIR authentication
- [ ] Persistent database storage (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- [ ] Additional FHIR resources (Condition, Procedure, DiagnosticReport)
- [ ] FHIR search parameters and modifiers
- [x] Bulk data export (FHIR Bulk Data Access)
- [ ] Subscription-based notifications

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or later
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sean-charles-allen/fhirside.git
cd fhirside
```

2. Restore dependencies:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

3. Build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```

4. Run the API:
```bash
cd src/FhirSide.Api
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `https://localhost:5001` (or `http://localhost:5000`).

### Using Docker

Build and run using Docker:
```bash
docker build -t fhirside .
docker run -p 8080:8080 fhirside
```

Or use Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## 📖 API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the interactive Swagger documentation at:
- **Development**: `https://localhost:5001/` or `http://localhost:5000/`
- **Docker**: `http://localhost:8080/`

### API Endpoints

#### Patient Resource
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/fhir/Patient` | Get all patients (as Bundle) |
| GET | `/fhir/Patient/{id}` | Get patient by ID |
| POST | `/fhir/Patient` | Create a new patient |
| PUT | `/fhir/Patient/{id}` | Update an existing patient |
| DELETE | `/fhir/Patient/{id}` | Delete a patient |

#### Encounter Resource
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/fhir/Encounter` | Get all encounters (as Bundle) |
| GET | `/fhir/Encounter/{id}` | Get encounter by ID |
| GET | `/fhir/Encounter/patient/{patientId}` | Get encounters for a patient |
| POST | `/fhir/Encounter` | Create a new encounter |
| PUT | `/fhir/Encounter/{id}` | Update an existing encounter |
| DELETE | `/fhir/Encounter/{id}` | Delete an encounter |

#### Observation Resource
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/fhir/Observation` | Get all observations (as Bundle) |
| GET | `/fhir/Observation/{id}` | Get observation by ID |
| GET | `/fhir/Observation/patient/{patientId}` | Get observations for a patient |
| POST | `/fhir/Observation` | Create a new observation |
| PUT | `/fhir/Observation/{id}` | Update an existing observation |
| DELETE | `/fhir/Observation/{id}` | Delete an observation |

#### MedicationRequest Resource
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/fhir/MedicationRequest` | Get all medication requests (as Bundle) |
| GET | `/fhir/MedicationRequest/{id}` | Get medication request by ID |
| GET | `/fhir/MedicationRequest/patient/{patientId}` | Get medication requests for a patient |
| POST | `/fhir/MedicationRequest` | Create a new medication request |
| PUT | `/fhir/MedicationRequest/{id}` | Update an existing medication request |
| DELETE | `/fhir/MedicationRequest/{id}` | Delete a medication request |

#### Bulk Data Export (FHIR Bulk Data Access IG)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/fhir/$export` | Initiate system-level bulk export |
| GET | `/fhir/Patient/$export` | Initiate patient-level bulk export |
| GET | `/fhir/$export-status/{jobId}` | Get export job status |
| GET | `/fhir/$export-download/{jobId}/{fileName}` | Download exported NDJSON file |
| DELETE | `/fhir/$export-status/{jobId}` | Delete export job |

##### Bulk Export Workflow
1. **Initiate Export**: Call `GET /fhir/$export` to start an export job
2. **Get Status URL**: Check the `Content-Location` header in the 202 response
3. **Poll for Status**: Call the status URL until export completes
4. **Download Files**: Use the URLs in the completed status response to download NDJSON files

##### Example
```bash
# Start export
curl -i http://localhost:5000/fhir/\$export
# Returns: 202 Accepted with Content-Location header

# Check status (use URL from Content-Location header)
curl http://localhost:5000/fhir/\$export-status/{jobId}
# Returns: Job status with download URLs when complete

# Download NDJSON file
curl http://localhost:5000/fhir/\$export-download/{jobId}/Patient.ndjson
```
